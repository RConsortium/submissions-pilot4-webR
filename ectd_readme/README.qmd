## Overview

The objective of the R Consortium R submission Pilot 4 Project is to test the concept that a Shiny application created with the R-language can be bundled with novel technologies and transferred successfully to FDA reviewers. The application was built as a modified version of the application contained R submission Pilot 2 Project, with materials available on the [RConsortium/submissions-pilot2](https://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-pilot2) repository, All submission materials and communications from this pilot are publicly available, with the aim of providing a working example for future R language based FDA submissions. This is a FDA-industry collaboration through the non-profit organization R consortium.
